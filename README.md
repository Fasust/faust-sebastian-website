### My Personal Website 

I created this website to further Improve my Front-End Development Skills.
Definitely not my expertice but I am pretty happy with the final Result.

I am also using this as a digital Business-Card / CV for Recruiters or other people interested in working with me.

> Full Disclosure: I used a Template from FreeHTML5.co as a base for this website. 
Thanks to the Team at FreeHTML5.co for providing such a nice base, you saved me a lot of work! :)
