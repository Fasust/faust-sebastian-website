### My Personal Website 
![Header](https://github.com/Fasust/faust-sebastian-website/blob/master/assets/screencap.PNG)

I created this website to further Improve my Front-End Development Skills.
Definitely not my expertice but I am pretty happy with the final Result.

I am also using this as a digital Business-Card / CV for Recruiters or other people interested in working with me.

> Full Disclosure: I used a Template from [FreeHTML5](https://freehtml5.co/) as a base for this website. 
Thanks to the Team at [FreeHTML5](https://freehtml5.co/) for providing such a nice base, you saved me a lot of work! :)
