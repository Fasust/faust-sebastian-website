        <h1>Section</h1>
        <p>In the following letter, I would like to introduce myself and show, why I am the right person to get the opportunity to study my semester abroad at your university. My name is Sebastian Faust and I am studying Media Informatics in my fourth semester at “TH Köln”, Campus Gummersbach and I would like to spend my fifth semester at „Westerdals Oslo ACT“.
            I have always felt drawn to the scandinavian part of europe. When I was a little boy, me and my family used to visit a little hut near a great lake in southern Norway. Late nights of barbecuing and early trips out onto the great lake in the morning are among my most treasured childhood memories.
            It has always been a big wish of mine, to work and live outside of Germany after completing my degree. I have already spent a great amount of my freetime traveling around Europe with my backpack. These trips gave me the opportunity to improve my English skills and taught me to approach people from different cultures, backgrounds and environments directly.
            The best part about backpacking is meeting new people with vastly different views, cultures and backgrounds. The „Westerdals Oslo ACT“ with their students from all over the world would give me the opportunity to experience this exact aspect of traveling on a daily basis.
            The wide spread spectrum of fields would also give me the chance to further develop my artistic side. The combination of the open and creative world of design and the logical and efficient world of computer science is my passion. I have invested many hours outside of university in developing little games and apps in which I have not only wrote the code, but also designed all the assets.
            I have been living in small towns in the German countryside all my life. I have always wanted to experience the buzzing, exciting and cosmopolitan life of a multicultural city like Oslo first hand. Living in a new city is not just about moving. It is about embracing all the new experiences, life lessons and challenges this city has to offer and I think Oslo is the place for me.
            All these factors in combination with the excellent reputation of „Westerdals Oslo ACT“ brought me to the conclusion that this semester abroad is the perfect next step for me, because I believe I am ready to take on the challenges this University, this course and the brilliant city of Oslo have to offer.
